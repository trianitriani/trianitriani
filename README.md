# Hi, I'm Lorenzo 👋

🎓 I'm a Master's student in Computer Engineering at the University of Pisa, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering**.

🧠 I’m passionate about machine learning, data science, and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. 

👨‍💻 You can find here a mix of academic projects, personal experiments, and collaborations — all aiming to sharpen my skills and contribute to open knowledge.

📚 I strongly believe in continuous learning and sharing what I discover. Whenever I can, I document my work to help others (and future me 😉).
